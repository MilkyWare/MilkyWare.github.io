When Microsoft started codebase migration from .NET Framework to .NET Core (now simply .NET), a number of features were to remain on .NET Framework. One such feature was the **server-side** codebase of **WCF** preventing WCF from being hosted in a .NET Core app.

Although Microsoft have deprecated WCF, I have found quite of lot of legacy applications rely on WCF for integration. In an ideal world, the integration would be migrated to more modern **REST or GraphQL** endpoints and the consuming application updated. However, this is often not possible. Fortunately, the .NET community have revived WCF through **Core WCF**.

## What is [Core WCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF)?

Core WCF **"is a port of the service side of Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) to .NET Core"**. This adds the capability of hosting a WCF endpoint in an **ASPNET Core** application along with its **[many benefits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/choose-aspnet-framework?view=aspnetcore-8.0#aspnet-core)**.

## Creating the WCF Endpoint

The Core WCF project provides a **[comprehensive walkthrough](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF/blob/main/Documentation/Walkthrough.md)** of creating a new WCF service and endpoint from scratch, however, this post will focus on the scenario of migrating an **existing WCF definition** to a Core WCF application.

### Generating the Service Contract

To generate **WCF proxy clients**, Microsoft provide **[dotnet-svcutil](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/additional-tools/dotnet-svcutil-guide?tabs=dotnetsvcutil2x)** which can generate the relevant C# objects from a WSDL file or endpoint. To install this tool run the below command:

``` powershell
dotnet tool install dotnet-svcutil --global --version "2.2.0-preview1.23462.5"
```

Notice that a preview version of the tool has been specified. At the time of writing, the current stable version does not include an argument we need which is `--serviceContract`. This argument skips the generation of the client as it's not needed for us to host the WCF service. The next command will then generate the **ServiceContract**:

``` powershell
dotnet svcutil .\path\to\wsdl.wsdl --namespace "*,Namespace.To.Use" --outputDir .\path\to\output\cs\ --serviceContract --noLogo
```

The command will then output a **Reference.cs** in the path specified similar to below:

``` cs
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// <auto-generated>
//     This code was generated by a tool.
//
//     Changes to this file may cause incorrect behavior and will be lost if
//     the code is regenerated.
// </auto-generated>
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

namespace Namespace.To.Use
{
    [System.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCodeAttribute("Microsoft.Tools.ServiceModel.Svcutil", "2.2.0-preview1.23462.5")]
    [System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute(Namespace="http://sample.xmlns.com", ConfigurationName="WcfService")]
    public interface WcfService
    {
        
        [System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute(Action="MyOperation", ReplyAction="*")]
        [System.ServiceModel.XmlSerializerFormatAttribute(SupportFaults=true)]
        System.Threading.Tasks.Task<myOperationResponse> myOperationAsync(myOperationRequest request);

        ...
    }

    ...
}
```

### Cleaning up the code

As mentioned, **dotnet-svcutil** is primarily used to create WCF proxy clients in **.NET**. However, with a few changes, the generated **Reference.cs** can be used to define the Core WCF service.

#### Renaming the interface

Depending on what the WSDL contains, the generated interface may not follow the typical convention of ***IServiceName***. Therefore I typically rename the interface to follow this convention.

#### Fix namespaces

As the WCF **client-side code** is still in .NET, the **System.ServiceModel** namespace needs to be replaced with the namespace **CoreWCF**. Typically, the generated code uses fully qualified class names and attributes, therefore, **CoreWCF** can be added as a using statement and System.ServiceModel removed using find and replace.

``` cs
using CoreWCF; 

namespace Namespace.To.Use
{
    [System.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCodeAttribute("Microsoft.Tools.ServiceModel.Svcutil", "2.2.0-preview1.23462.5")]
    [ServiceContractAttribute(Namespace="http://sample.xmlns.com", ConfigurationName="WcfService")]
    public interface WcfService
    {
        ...
    }

    ...
}
```

#### Fix attribute convention

Another tidy-up step is to remove the **Attribute** suffix to follow C# convention. Once again, this can be done using **find and replace** e.g. ServiceContractAttribute becomes ServiceContract.

#### Remove OperationContract ReplyAction

The generated operations may include the attribute property **ReplyAction**.

``` cs
[OperationContract(Action="MyOperation", ReplyAction="*")]
[XmlSerializerFormat(SupportFaults=true)]
System.Threading.Tasks.Task<myOperationResponse> myOperationAsync(myOperationRequest request);
```

This can cause issues when consuming the WSDL of the CoreWCF service. After some research, **[a StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32760079/wcf-the-contract-x-in-client-configuration-does-not-match-the-name-in-service)** suggested removing these properties which has so far resolved the issue.

### Implementing the service

With the WCF contract generated and tidied up, the service can now be implemented in a service class.

``` cs
public class WcfService : IWcfService
  {
      private readonly ILogger _logger;

      public WcfService(ILogger<WcfService> logger)
      {
          _logger = logger;
      }

      public string GetData(int value)
      {
          throw new NotImplementedException();
      }

      public CompositeType GetDataUsingDataContract(CompositeType composite)
      {
          throw new NotImplementedException();
      }
  }
```

To register the generated **ServiceContract** and implemented service, the simplest way is to follow the **[walkthrough provided by CoreWCF](#what-is-core-wcf)** and replace the sample ServiceContract and implementation.

One thing to note, in the above C# snippet, **ILogger** is injected as is typical of an ASPNET Core app. The sample project in the walkthrough **does demonstrate dependency injection**. To allow services to be injected, the implemented WCF service needs to be added to the **ServiceCollection**

``` cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder();

builder.Services.AddServiceModelServices();
builder.Services.AddServiceModelMetadata();
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IServiceBehavior, UseRequestHeadersForMetadataAddressBehavior>();

builder.Services.AddTransient<WcfService>();

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseServiceModel(serviceBuilder =>
{
    serviceBuilder.AddService<WcfService>();
    serviceBuilder.AddServiceEndpoint<WcfService, IWcfService>(new BasicHttpBinding(BasicHttpSecurityMode.Transport), "/Service.svc");
    var serviceMetadataBehavior = app.Services.GetRequiredService<ServiceMetadataBehavior>();
    serviceMetadataBehavior.HttpsGetEnabled = true;
});

app.Run();
```
